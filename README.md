SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage success landing prediction with Machine Learning Models  
  
This is the rersult of the IBM Data Science Certification capstone.  

## We will predict if the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.

Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.  
This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

## Winning Space Race with Data Science

### Introduction

In the project's introduction, we highlight the background and context of the study, focusing on SpaceX and its Falcon 9 rocket launches. SpaceX stands out by offering significantly lower prices, with a launch cost of $62 million compared to competitors' prices exceeding $165 million. This cost reduction stems from SpaceX's ability to recover and reuse the Falcon 9's first stage. If we can accurately predict the success of the first stage landing, it becomes possible to determine the cost associated with each launch. This valuable information can empower alternative companies to compete against SpaceX by making informed decisions when bidding for rocket launches, potentially challenging SpaceX's market dominance.

### Problems

- Understand the factors influencing successful rocket landing.
- Correlation between features and landing success.
- Optimal operational conditions for successful landings.

#### Insights drawn from EDA

##### Flight Number vs. Launch Site

![](assets/13.png)  

The larger the flight amount at a launch site, the greater the success rate at a launch site.  

##### Payload vs. Launch Site

![](assets/14.png)  

It seems that the greater the payload for Launch Site CCAFS SCL 40, the higher the success rate for the rocket. However, there is not a quite clear pattern for the other Launch Sites.

##### Success Rate vs. Orbit Type

![](assets/15.png)  
The most success rate are for the orbits:  
- ES-L1
- GEO
- HEO
- SSO

![](assets/5.png)  

##### Flight Number vs. Orbit Type

![](assets/16.png)  

In the LEO orbit, it seems to have a relation between the number of flights and the success. However, the GTO orbit shows no relationship between flight number and success.

##### Payload vs. Orbit Type

![](assets/17.png)  

Heavy payloads seems to have a negative influence on GTO orbits and positive on LEO and ISS orbits.

#### Build a Dashboard with Plotly Dash

##### Total Success Launches By Site

![](assets/32.png)  

KSC LC-39 A has the most successful launches

##### Total Success Launches for KSC LC-39A

![](assets/33.png)  

KSC LC-39A achieved a 76,6% success rate.

##### Payload vs Success for Booster Category

![](assets/34.png)  

We can see that the success rate is higher for low weighted payloads.

### Predective Analysis (Classification)

#### Classification Accuracy

![](assets/35.png)  

The Decision Tree model has the highest classification accuracy.

#### Confusion Matrix

![](assets/12.png)  

The Decision Tree model predicted 12 landed and 3 not landed right. But missed 3 not landed.

### Conclusions

#### Correlation between launch site activity and success rate

There is a positive relationship between the number of flights conducted at a launch site and the likelihood of a successful launch. As the flight amount increases at a particular site, the success rate also tends to increase.  

#### Temporal trends in launch success

Starting from 2013 and continuing until 2020, there has been a notable upward trend in launch success rates. Over this period, the probability of a successful launch has been consistently increasing.  

#### Success rates for different orbits

Orbits such as ES-L1, GEO, HEO, SSO, and VLEO demonstrate the highest success rates compared to other orbits. These specific orbits have shown a greater likelihood of achieving a successful mission.  

#### Outstanding performance of KSC LC-39A launch site

Among all launch sites, KSC LC-39A stands out as the site with the highest number of successful launches. It has consistently achieved a remarkable track record in terms of launch success.  

#### Optimal machine learning algorithm

The Decision Tree model has been identified as the most effective machine learning algorithm for this particular task. It outperforms other algorithms in accurately predicting the success or failure of rocket launches.
